--[[ questionBot 1.0.0
    By Andrew for the ModdedMC Network ATM9 server
    This program is designed to answer common questions in chat on the ModdedMC Network ATM9 server.
    This program is designed to be run on a computer with a chat box peripheral.
    BUILT FOR PERSONAL USE! DO NOT SHARE!
    Later versions will have more questions, depending on what I see in chat and approval from staff to use links.
